# The 'hashbang' command is used to chop the hashbang line
# off the current file, then run the the arguments to
# hashbang on that file.
#
# For example, let's say that you have a text file called 'catme'
# that you want to display running 'cat'
#
# The file would then start with
#
# #! hashbang /bin/cat
#
# hashbang will then chop the first line off of the file, then run the
# rest of the file through cat.
